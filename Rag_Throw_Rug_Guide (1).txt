How to Make a Rag Throw Rug

Recycling old fabric into a handmade throw rug is an eco-friendly and creative project. Below are several methods to make a rag rug, including braided, woven, and crocheted techniques.

Materials Needed:
- Old clothes, sheets, or fabric scraps
- Scissors or rotary cutter
- Needle and thread (for sewing method)
- A large safety pin or crochet hook (depending on the method)
- A non-slip rug pad (optional, for stability)

Method 1: Braided Rag Rug (Sewn)
1. Cut Fabric Strips:
   - Cut fabric into long strips, about 1 to 2 inches wide.
   - Join strips by sewing or knotting ends together.

2. Start Braiding:
   - Take three fabric strips and knot them together at one end.
   - Braid tightly, adding new strips as needed.

3. Shape the Rug:
   - Coil the braided fabric into a spiral (like a snail shell).
   - Stitch the braid together with a needle and thread as you go.

4. Finish:
   - Secure the end by tucking it under and stitching it in place.

Method 2: Woven Rag Rug (Using a DIY Loom)
1. Make a Loom:
   - Use a wooden frame or cardboard with evenly spaced nails or slits.

2. Set the Warp (Base Strings):
   - Stretch fabric strips vertically across the loom.

3. Weave the Fabric Strips:
   - Weave strips over and under the warp threads, alternating each row.

4. Secure the Edges:
   - Tie off the ends or sew a backing to keep the rug sturdy.

Method 3: Crochet Rag Rug
1. Cut Fabric into Strips:
   - Cut 1-inch-wide fabric strips and connect them by tying or sewing.

2. Make a Fabric Yarn Ball:
   - Roll fabric into a large ball, similar to yarn.

3. Start Crocheting:
   - Use a large crochet hook (size P or Q) to crochet in a circular or rectangular pattern.

4. Finish the Rug:
   - Weave in loose ends for a clean look.

Tips for a Better Rug:
✔ Use cotton or jersey fabric for flexibility.
✔ Wash and iron fabric before cutting for a neater look.
✔ Add a non-slip backing for safety on hardwood floors.

Enjoy your handmade rag throw rug!

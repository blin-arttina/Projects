How to Make Homemade Play-Doh

Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup salt
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp cream of tartar (optional, but makes the dough last longer)
- 1.5 cups water
- Food coloring (optional)

Instructions:
1. Mix Dry Ingredients:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, and cream of tartar.

2. Heat the Mixture:
   - In a saucepan, mix the water and vegetable oil over low heat.
   - If using food coloring, add it to the water before combining with dry ingredients.

3. Combine and Stir:
   - Slowly add the dry ingredients to the pan while stirring constantly.
   - Stir until the dough thickens and forms a ball (about 2-3 minutes).

4. Cool and Knead:
   - Remove from heat and let the dough cool for a few minutes.
   - Once cool enough to handle, knead the dough for about 5 minutes until soft and smooth.

5. Store Properly:
   - Store in an airtight container or a ziplock bag to keep it fresh for weeks.

Optional Add-ins:
- Essential oils (lavender, lemon, or peppermint for a nice scent)
- Glitter for sparkly playdough
- Different colors (divide the dough and mix in separate colors)

Enjoy your homemade playdough!

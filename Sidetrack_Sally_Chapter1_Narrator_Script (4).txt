Sidetrack Sally: The First Gathering (Chapter 1)

It was a crisp autumn evening when Sally found herself wandering the city streets once again. 
She wasn’t lost—Sally never really got lost—she just had a habit of taking the long way around. 
Some called her easily distracted, but she preferred the term “spontaneous.”

Tonight, though, she was on a mission. She had heard whispers about a gathering—a meeting of the usual misfits she found herself tangled up with. 
The kind of night where anything could happen.

She tugged her jacket tighter around her shoulders as the cool wind whipped through the streets. 
The neon lights of the city blinked above her, flickering like a secret code only she could read.

As she approached the meeting spot—an old diner with a flickering “Open” sign—she spotted Skater Skip, lounging outside with his skateboard propped against the wall.

“Sally! Took you long enough!” he called, grinning as he flipped his board up with his foot.

“I got sidetracked,” she admitted with a smirk, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face.

Skip just shook his head. “Of course you did.”

Inside, the diner buzzed with energy. Zen Zena was already settled in a corner booth, sipping on a cup of herbal tea like she had all the time in the world. 
Across from her, Grumpy Gus sat with his arms crossed, his usual scowl deepening as he muttered about the noise level.

Near the jukebox, Creative Callie and Darling Danielle were deep in conversation, probably plotting their next big idea—whatever that might be. 
And then, there was Ambush Annie, leaning against the counter, eyes scanning the room like she was waiting for something… or someone.

Sally slid into the booth next to Zen Zena and sighed. “So, what’s the deal? Why the big gathering?”

Zena smiled, her voice calm as always. “Change is in the air, Sally. It’s time we all started paying attention.”

Sally raised an eyebrow. “To what?”

Before Zena could answer, the diner’s door swung open with a bang, and in strode Dark Dan, his presence as electrifying as ever. 
The air seemed to shift, the mood tilting into something unpredictable.

Skip groaned. “Oh great, here we go.”

Dan smirked, shoving his hands into his pockets. “Miss me?”

The group exchanged glances, the night stretching out before them—full of possibility, full of trouble.

And Sally?

She was exactly where she was meant to be.

# Sidetrack Sally and the Gang Investigate: The Secrets Beyond the Solar System
## Chapter 1: Interstellar Visitors – Objects from Beyond

### **Introduction: A Mysterious Arrival**
The stars had always fascinated Sally and the Gang, but nothing prepared them for what they were about to uncover. 
After their investigation into the Solar System’s anomalies, they received an **urgent new message**—this time, 
it warned of **objects moving through space that didn’t belong.** 

The message referenced something called **‘Oumuamua,** a strange, elongated object that had passed through the Solar 
System in **2017.** It was unlike anything seen before, moving in ways that defied expectations. The Gang knew this was 
their next mystery to unravel.

## **1.1 The Mystery of ‘Oumuamua**
### **A Visitor from Another Star**
When astronomers first spotted ‘Oumuamua, they quickly realized it was moving too fast to be from our own Solar System. 
It had arrived from deep space and was already heading out before anyone had a chance to study it closely.

### **A Shape Unlike Any Other**
Unlike typical asteroids or comets, ‘Oumuamua was **long and cigar-shaped**, with a surface that reflected light strangely. 
Some even compared it to an **interstellar probe**, tumbling chaotically as it sped away.

### **The Acceleration That Made No Sense**
The most puzzling detail was that **‘Oumuamua accelerated** as it left the Solar System—without any visible means of propulsion. 
Comets do this by expelling gas, but ‘Oumuamua had **no tail, no visible outgassing.** Could it have been **an artificial object** 
using unknown technology?

## **1.2 Other Interstellar Visitors – The Case of Borisov**
### **A More "Normal" Interstellar Object**
Unlike ‘Oumuamua, another object, **2I/Borisov**, entered the Solar System in **2019** and behaved like a regular comet. 
It had an icy tail and a clear origin from another solar system.

### **Why Was ‘Oumuamua Different?**
Borisov acted **like any other comet**, while ‘Oumuamua remained an anomaly. Some scientists suggested it was a **"cosmic iceberg"** 
of frozen hydrogen that sublimated away invisibly—but no evidence confirmed this.

### **Are More Interstellar Objects Coming?**
Astronomers now believe that many **such objects** have entered our Solar System before—we just never had the technology to see them. 
Are we constantly being visited by **deep-space travelers, natural or artificial?**

## **1.3 The Hypothetical Fleet – More Objects on the Way?**
### **Unidentified Objects in Space**
With better telescopes, researchers expect to find **many more interstellar objects** in the coming years. Could one of these objects 
finally prove that **someone—or something—sent them?**

### **The Probe Hypothesis**
Some scientists propose that objects like ‘Oumuamua could be **alien probes, designed to drift between stars and silently gather information.**  
Could an advanced civilization be **monitoring planets like Earth without revealing themselves?**

### **What Else Is Hiding in Deep Space?**
The Gang realized that if interstellar objects were passing through unnoticed, **what else might be out there, hidden in the cosmic dark?**

## **Conclusion: The Next Clue**
Just as they finished reviewing the data, another encrypted message appeared:

  **"Earth is not alone in the search. The mirrors in the sky reflect more than light. Seek the twins among the stars."**

The Gang knew their next mission was clear—**they had to investigate exoplanets, the distant worlds beyond our Solar System.**

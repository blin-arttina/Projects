Chapter 3: The Origins of Creation Myths

The gang sat around the table, examining old maps, ancient texts, and handwritten notes. They debated the origins of 
creation stories across civilizations, questioning whether they were merely myths or descriptions of real events.

Sumer: The First Recorded Creation Story

Their first stop was Sumer, where they studied the Enuma Elish, the ancient Babylonian creation epic. The story describes 
Tiamat, the goddess of chaos, who was defeated by Marduk, the warrior god. Marduk split Tiamat’s body to form the heavens 
and the earth, bringing order out of chaos. The gang also investigated the Anunnaki, divine beings believed to have 
influenced humanity’s destiny.

Egypt: The Cosmic Egg and the Divine Waters

In Egypt, the gang explored the Pyramid Texts and the myth of Ra emerging from the Cosmic Egg, bringing light and life to 
the world. Other versions described creation as emerging from the primeval waters of Nun, with Atum and Ptah shaping reality 
through divine speech. The recurring theme of creation from chaos fascinated the group.

India: Cycles of Creation and Destruction

In India, they studied Hindu creation myths and the Yugas—the great cycles of time governing the universe. They learned 
about Brahma, the creator, emerging from a lotus growing from Vishnu’s navel, and Shiva’s role in destruction and renewal. 
The group pondered whether these cycles hinted at lost civilizations wiped away by past cataclysms.

China: Pangu and the Cosmic Separation

The Chinese creation myth described Pangu, a primordial being who emerged from a Cosmic Egg and separated heaven from 
earth. As Pangu grew, he held the sky apart, and upon his death, his body transformed into the mountains, rivers, and 
forests of the world.

Mesoamerica: The Feathered Serpent and the Lords of Creation

The gang explored the Popol Vuh, the Maya creation story, where gods attempted multiple versions of humanity before 
succeeding. They also studied the legend of Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, who played a crucial role in guiding 
civilization and knowledge.

Polynesia: The Sky Father and Earth Mother

In Polynesian mythology, Rangi (Sky Father) and Papa (Earth Mother) were locked in an eternal embrace until their children 
separated them, creating the world. This theme of divine separation to bring forth life resonated with similar myths 
from other cultures.

A Shared Truth?

After comparing these myths, the gang recognized common themes—creation from chaos, cosmic eggs, divine beings shaping 
the world, and cycles of destruction and renewal. Could these myths be remnants of a shared history lost to time?

Determined to uncover more, they set their sights on ancient ruins, hoping to find physical evidence supporting these 
myths.

The truth, they believed, was waiting to be rediscovered.

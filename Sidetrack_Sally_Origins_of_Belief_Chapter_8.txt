The gang investigated ancient warnings about global catastrophes. Were past civilizations wiped out by disasters 
they saw coming? And could it happen again?

The Great Flood: A Shared Memory of Disaster

Nearly every ancient culture had a flood myth:

- The Epic of Gilgamesh (Sumerian) – A great flood wiped out civilization.
- Noah’s Ark (Biblical) – A worldwide flood destroyed all but a chosen few.
- Hindu Flood Myths – The god Vishnu warned King Manu of an impending flood.
- Mayan and Hopi Flood Stories – Civilizations swallowed by water.

Were these just myths, or memories of a real global catastrophe?

The Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

Around 12,800 years ago, a comet or asteroid may have struck Earth, triggering climate changes and ending the Ice Age. 
This event may have wiped out advanced prehistoric civilizations, possibly including Atlantis.

Cycles of Catastrophe and Ancient Timekeeping

Ancient cultures tracked great cycles of destruction:

- The Hindu Yuga Cycles described ages of creation and destruction.
- The Mayan Long Count Calendar predicted past and future shifts.
- The Egyptian Zep Tepi Myth hinted at an earlier, lost civilization.

Were these calendars warnings of repeating cataclysms?

Pole Shifts and Earth Changes

Some ancient texts spoke of landmasses shifting in disasters. Modern science confirms magnetic pole shifts are happening 
faster than before. Could ancient civilizations have known about these cycles?

Underground Cities and Survival Bunkers

Derinkuyu, Turkey, is an underground city capable of housing 20,000 people. Did ancient civilizations go underground 
to survive past cataclysms? Similar sites around the world suggest they did.

Are We Next?

The gang realized the big question:

- If past civilizations warned about disasters, why don’t we take them seriously?
- Did they leave behind knowledge we’ve ignored?
- Could we be nearing the next global shift?

Their next mission: Investigating modern efforts to rediscover ancient knowledge before it’s too late.

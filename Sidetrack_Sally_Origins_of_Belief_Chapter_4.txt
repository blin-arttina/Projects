Sidetrack Sally and the Gang Investigate the Origins of Belief
Chapter 4: Lost Civilizations and Forbidden Histories

The gang set out to investigate lost civilizations, searching for evidence that history may not be as simple as it seems. 
Their journey took them from the sands of Egypt to the jungles of Central America, the hidden pyramids of China, and the 
mysterious ruins of the Pacific.

Egypt: The Great Pyramids and the Hall of Records

Standing before the Great Pyramid of Giza, the gang questioned mainstream history. If this was a tomb, where was the 
evidence? The precision of the pyramid’s alignment, its enormous stone blocks, and its correlation to Orion’s Belt led 
them to wonder if it was far older than believed.

They also explored the theory of the Hall of Records beneath the Sphinx, said to contain knowledge from a lost civilization.

Central America: The Pyramids of the Maya and Aztecs

In Mexico and Guatemala, they discovered pyramids nearly identical to those in Egypt. The Maya’s Long Count Calendar 
tracked cosmic cycles with astonishing accuracy, while the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Teotihuacan contained traces 
of liquid mercury beneath it—just like China’s ancient pyramids.

China: The Forbidden Pyramids and the Emperor’s Tomb

China’s hidden pyramids, some covered with earth to conceal their presence, intrigued the gang. The tomb of the First 
Emperor, Qin Shi Huang, was said to contain an underground model of the heavens, a lake of mercury, and unknown artifacts. 
Why did the Chinese government refuse to excavate these sites? What were they hiding?

Gobekli Tepe: The 12,000-Year-Old Enigma

In Turkey, they visited Gobekli Tepe, a site older than any known civilization. The megalithic structures suggested 
advanced knowledge long before the advent of cities or agriculture. Even more puzzling, the site had been intentionally 
buried. Was someone trying to preserve or hide something?

Nan Madol: The Lost City in the Pacific

In the Pacific, they explored Nan Madol, an ancient city built on artificial islands. The massive basalt stones had been 
stacked without mortar, with local legends attributing their movement to levitation or lost technology. Could this be 
evidence of an unknown civilization?

A Lost Chapter of History?

The gang pieced together common elements from their travels: pyramids aligned with stars, unexplained technological feats, 
and sites deliberately hidden or ignored. 

What if history had been erased? What if an advanced civilization existed before recorded history, only to be lost to time?

Their next mission: investigating the sudden disappearances of entire civilizations—Atlantis, the Sea Peoples, and lost 
empires that vanished without explanation.

The deeper they dug, the stranger the truth became…

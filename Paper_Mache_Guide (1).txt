How to Make Paper Mache

Materials Needed:
- Newspaper or paper strips
- 1 cup flour (or white glue for a stronger mixture)
- 1-2 cups water
- A mixing bowl
- A whisk or spoon
- A balloon, cardboard, or other structure for shaping
- Paint and brushes (for decoration)

Instructions:
1. Prepare the Paper:
   - Tear or cut newspaper into strips (about 1 inch wide).
   - Avoid using glossy paper, as it doesn’t absorb well.

2. Make the Paste:
   - Flour Paste Method:
     - Mix 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of water in a bowl.
     - Stir until smooth and lump-free. Add more water if needed for a runny consistency.
     - Optional: Add a teaspoon of salt to prevent mold.
   - Glue Paste Method:
     - Mix equal parts white glue and water in a bowl.
     - Stir until well combined.

3. Apply the Paper Mache:
   - Dip a paper strip into the paste, then remove excess paste by running it between your fingers.
   - Layer the wet strips over your mold (balloon, cardboard, or wireframe).
   - Continue layering 3-4 layers, allowing each layer to dry slightly before adding another.

4. Let It Dry:
   - Leave the paper mache in a dry place to air dry for 12-24 hours.
   - For faster drying, use a fan or low-heat hairdryer.

5. Paint and Decorate:
   - Once completely dry, paint and decorate your project as desired.
   - Use acrylic paint for best results, and seal with a clear varnish if needed.

Fun Project Ideas:
- Paper Mache Mask – Shape over a balloon and cut eye holes.
- Piñata – Create a hollow shape, fill it with treats, and decorate.
- Decorative Bowls – Mold over an upside-down bowl for unique décor.

Enjoy your paper mache craft!

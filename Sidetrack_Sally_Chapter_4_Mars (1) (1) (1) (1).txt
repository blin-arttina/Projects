## Chapter 4: Mars – The Red Planet’s Ruins

### **Introduction: A Desert of Secrets**
With the latest clue pointing toward Mars, the Gang prepared to investigate the mysteries of the Red Planet. Mars had long 
been a source of speculation—ancient canals, a face in the sand, and whispers of a lost civilization. But what was fact, 
and what was fiction? As they dug deeper into the archives, they found evidence that something on Mars didn’t quite add up.

## **4.1 The Face on Mars and Cydonia Region**
### **NASA’s Controversial Images**
In 1976, NASA’s Viking 1 orbiter took a photograph of what appeared to be a giant, human-like face on the Martian surface. 
Located in the **Cydonia region**, the "Face on Mars" quickly became one of the most debated images in space exploration.

### **Natural Formation or Ancient Monument?**
Later NASA missions, such as Mars Global Surveyor, captured new images with better resolution, showing the face as a 
weathered hill. However, some believe the "updated images" were digitally altered to downplay the structure’s artificial 
appearance.

### **Other Unusual Structures in Cydonia**
Beyond the face, other formations in Cydonia have raised eyebrows, including **pyramid-like hills arranged in geometric 
patterns**. Could these be remnants of an ancient Martian civilization?

## **4.2 Martian Underground Structures**
### **The "Glass Tunnels" of Mars**
Several rover images show long, tube-like formations beneath the Martian surface. These have been interpreted as collapsed 
lava tubes, but some suggest they resemble **ancient transportation tunnels** or even **habitats once used by intelligent 
beings**.

### **Lava Tubes as Potential Shelters**
Scientists today propose that **future Mars colonists** could live in lava tubes to shield themselves from radiation. Could 
it be that an ancient Martian race once did the same?

### **Subsurface Anomalies**
NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected **strange magnetic anomalies and heat signatures beneath the surface**, 
hinting at unknown geological or artificial structures.

## **4.3 Water and Life Clues**
### **Evidence of Liquid Water**
For years, scientists debated whether Mars had liquid water. Today, we know that **briny water streaks appear on the planet’s 
surface**, confirming that liquid water still exists in some form.

### **Methane Spikes and Possible Microbial Life**
Methane has been detected on Mars, and it fluctuates in ways that suggest it might be produced by living organisms beneath 
the surface.

### **Could Mars Still Be Home to Life?**
If microbial life exists beneath Mars today, could something more complex have lived there in the past? Some believe that 
if Mars was once Earth-like, a lost civilization could have thrived before the planet became barren.

## **Conclusion: A New Clue**
Sally and the Gang decipher another message:

  "The watchtower in the dark is not what it seems. The bright eye beyond holds hidden light."

Their next destination? **Ceres, the mysterious dwarf planet in the Asteroid Belt.**

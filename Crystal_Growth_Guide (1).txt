How to Grow Crystals at Home

Materials Needed:
- A glass jar
- Hot water
- A stirring stick (spoon or wooden skewer)
- A piece of string
- A pencil or chopstick
- Your choice of crystal-growing substance:
  - Table salt (sodium chloride)
  - Sugar (for rock candy)
  - Borax (for faster-growing crystals)

Instructions:
1. Boil the Water:
   - Heat about 1 cup of water until it’s very hot but not boiling.
   - Pour the hot water into the glass jar.

2. Dissolve the Crystal Substance:
   - Gradually add your chosen substance (salt, sugar, or borax) to the hot water, stirring constantly.
   - Keep adding until no more dissolves, meaning you’ve reached a saturated solution.

3. Prepare the Crystal Seed String:
   - Tie a small object (like a paperclip or small rock) to one end of the string.
   - Tie the other end to a pencil or chopstick so that it dangles inside the jar but does not touch the bottom.

4. Let It Sit:
   - Place the jar in a quiet, undisturbed location at room temperature.
   - Allow the solution to cool and start forming crystals around the string.
   - This may take hours to several days, depending on the substance used.

5. Observe and Grow Larger Crystals:
   - If you want bigger crystals, remove a formed crystal and place it in a new supersaturated solution to continue growth.

Crystal Growth Time:
- Salt Crystals: 1-2 days
- Sugar Crystals (Rock Candy): 5-7 days
- Borax Crystals: 4-6 hours (fastest)
